        <p>Richard grew on Korean and Indonesia food as he spend his childhood abroad in Asia.
            Pursuing higher education in the United States, he found out that others
            thought that food from Asia is delicious. He began cooking for his friends
            each week. Soon, the fame of his food spread across his university, and he
            decided to start a restaurant. That restaurant is Hometown Cuisine.
