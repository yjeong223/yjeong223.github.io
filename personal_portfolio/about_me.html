        <p id="about_me_txt">Hi there, my name is Yu Chan Jeong! I learned about Computer Science in my undergraduate degree and am working in the IT industry.
            Since a few years a go and expecially today, AI of all kinds have progressed and proliferated, and my interest has been peaked. 
            I would love to deepen my theoretical and practical understanding of AI beyond the course that I
            I learned in college. I am looking to pursue a Master's in AI and accomplish my goal of contributing to the development AI. I'd love 
            to talk more about AI--its industry use, future potential, projects, and more. Feel free to give me a ding on LinkedIn, and I'd love to connect with you. 
        </p>
