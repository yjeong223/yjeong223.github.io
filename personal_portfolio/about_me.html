        <p id="about_me_txt">Hi there! my name is Yu Chan Jeong, and I am currently a senior in college looking to jump into the tech industry. 
            Funny thing, when I first arrived at college, I thought I wanted to study kinesiology with the hope of becoming a chiropractor. 
            Unexpectedly, everything changed when I took 
            my introductory programming class. I had so much fun learning about programming and building software that I switched over to 
            Computer Science. That was one of the best decisions that I have made in life, and I am really grateful for it. I hope my journey as a 
            computer science student doesn't end here but rather, would continue in the workforce.
